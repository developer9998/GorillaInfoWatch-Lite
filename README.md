# GorillaInfoWatch Lite
A public demo release of *GorillaInfoWatch*, a general purpose utility mod for Gorilla Tag.

## Features
*GorillaInfoWatch* contains many features that makes it different from any other watch mod you can use.

### Scoreboard
The scoreboard included with *GorillaInfoWatch* is stylized with custom art assets and is updated to reflect on who is in the room you are in.

You can inspect room and player details you wouldn't want to go without.

### Details
The details provided by *GorillaInfoWatch* contains basic player information, user economy and catalog, safety configuration, and statistics.

### Friends
The friends shown by *GorillaInfoWatch* reflects on your friends list used by the friend system in-game, not to be confused with those added with GorillaFriends.

Unlike the friend system, friend names are nearly guaranteed to always display, alongside an option to remotely set your privary configuration.

### Mod Status
The mods listred by *GorillaInfoWatch* can be enabled and disabled when applicable, and sorted for convience.

In the paid release (see more about it below), the mod inspector can use to view details about and configure the mod.

### Player Significance
Each player in the game, including yourself, will likely have some form of significance, ranging anywhere from room master, to representing a group, and even as a recognized user.

The mod uses GorillaFriends to expand significance to including friends, verified (in light green), and recently played with users (in light red).

### Notifications
It's always nice to be notified of information when you need it the most, and GorillaInfoWatch has you covered!

In this release includes notifications for when certain players (a friend, verified, or recognized player*) joins or leaves the room.<br><sup>* Notifies when any player is recognized at any time</sup>

In the paid release (again, view more below), notifications expand to room join failures, quest completions, and so on.

### Custom Screens
The majority of the features listed prior to this are known as "screens", though built-in to the mod, don't differ much from custom screens.

With knowledge in mod development and the infrastructure of GorillaInfoWatch, developers can create their own custom screens using widgets and utilites to be run by GorillaInfoWatch.

## Usage
To use GorillaInfoWatch, press on the face of the info watch located on your left hand, and interact with the menu using various widgets and set buttons at the bottom.
